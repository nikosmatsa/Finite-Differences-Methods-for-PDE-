# Finite-Differences-Methods-for-PDE-




This repository is part of my work in the lesson of Finite  Difference Methods for PDE in my MS.c in Applied Mathematical Sciences in NTUA, 
under the scientific guidance of professor Dr.Georgoulis. All the different files in python are subject to chapters of
Dr.Georgoulis notes on this lesson.
